## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

- Do not open a public issue.
- Create a private security advisory via GitHub Security Advisories ("Security" tab) or email the maintainers.
- Include steps to reproduce, affected versions, and any relevant details.
- We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and work on a fix before public disclosure.

Thank you for helping keep users safe.
